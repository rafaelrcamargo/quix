# ‚ö°Ô∏è Getting started

</a>

First, to clarify the purpose of this project, as developers, we know the importance of a fast and reliable developer experience. Time to get started!

<a name="commands">

# ‚öôÔ∏è Commands

</a>

As we know, this CLI is under development, so we have implemented a few commands to help you get started. The following are the available commands:

## ‚õìÔ∏è Link

> Links the project to the current workspace.

This command will synchronize the local project with the remote VTEX account you are logged in. _(At the moment, the login and use commands are not implemented, use the [VTEX IO CLI](toolbelt) instead.)_

### Usage

```bash
qx link <FLAGS>
```

### Flags

| Flag | Description                                                |
| :--: | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-c` | Clean the project cache before linking.                    |
| `-q` | Link the project **quicker**. (By ignoring some steps. üëÄ) |

<a name="installation">

# üì¶ Installation

</a>

First of all, check our [releases]("https://github.com/rafaelrcamargo/quix/releases") page to download the latest version of the CLI.

Then we need to setup the CLI, for an easy process, we have created a script to do this for you. Just run the following command:

<summary>üñ•Ô∏è Windows</summary>

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafaelrcamargo/quix/main/release/add_to_path.ps1?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABQRQIGNWZVRGJSTIAH46OLAYZYP4VQ -OutFile install.ps1; .\install.ps1
```

```

# üïµÔ∏è Known issues

</a>

<details open>
<summary>VSCode - Terminal not rendering properly?</summary>
<br>
That's a known issue, and it's related to the way VSCode handles the terminal. To fix this, just open the vscode settings and add the following line:

```json
{
  ...
  "terminal.integrated.gpuAcceleration": "on"
}
```

This will enable the GPU acceleration for the terminal, and it will fix the rendering issue.

> For now this solves the issue, but can get kinda weird with some appearance settings.

## üßÆ Improvements

</summary>

<br>
One of the biggest improvements we have made is the performance, and thats the foundation of this project.

But no one ever knows for sure what is the best way to improve the performance of a project in every situation, so we have implemented and documented some benchmarks to help in our conclusions.

This list of benchmarks is not exhaustive, but it is a good starting point to understand how to improve the performance of this project, and to this moment we've documented the following:

### üìà Benchmarks

- [üõë Minifier](/benchmarks/minifier/results.md)
  - The idea behind this benchmark is to compare the performance of the minifier crate, and the VTEX IO Link endpoint. Comparing the performance of the raw files, and the minified files in the first and subsequent `quix link` commands.
